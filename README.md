# pipelined-processor-simulator
A pipelined, functional processor simulator for the reduced MIPS R3000 ISA.


Project Objective

a) Implement a pipelined, functional processor simulator for the reduced MIPS R3000 ISA.

b) Design your own test case to validate your implementation, particularly on hazards handling.



Test Script & Test Case:

a) Test cases are in 'student_valid_testcase' written by classmates.

b) New test cases could be generated by my another project 'mips-assembler' with assembly languages: https://github.com/zelzhang/mips-assembler

c) Run 'test_script.py' to run all test cases in 'student_valid_testcase'
